# 📎 AGN Field Mechanics: Blueprint for Emergent Intelligence

This document expands on the architectural, logical, and semantic foundations of **Active Graph Networks (AGNs)**. It is a reference point for developers, architects, and researchers building systems that remember, reason, and evolve.

## A1. The Core Law: Identity Across Time

> **"X (structure), Y (purpose), Z (meaning) define n (identity) across T (time)."**

### Identity Equation:
```text
n(t) = f(X, Y, Z, T)
```

### Interpretation:
- **X (What)** → Structural form (e.g., raw data, frame, symbol)
- **Y (Why)** → Relational purpose (e.g., link, edge, intent)
- **Z (How)** → Policy or behavioral logic
- **n(t)** → Identity as a function of context over time
- **T** → Temporal axis: defines rate and sequence of transformation

> Identity is **relational context over time**, not a static tag.

## A2. Frame Lifecycle (Visual Cortex Logic)

```mermaid
graph LR
    Camera --> Frame["Raw Frame"]
    Frame --> Process["Scene Diff Engine"]
    Process --> Tensor[".pt Tensor Memory"]
    Tensor --> Node["AGN Node Generator"]
    Node --> AGDB["Stored in AGDB"]
```

Each frame becomes a **relational node**, stored **only when identity meaning shifts** beyond a threshold (`Δn > θ`).

---

## A3. Relational Query Flow (ActiveShell)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UserQuery["Get-Node Frame Where Context.Mood = 'Calm'"]
    --> ContextMapping["Cube4D Context Mapping"]
    --> Result["Return: Frame + Metadata"]
```

### Noun-Verb-Truth (NVT) Query Model
```bash
Get-Node Frame Where Mood = "Calm"
Create-Edge Influences Between SceneA and SceneB
Analyze-Pattern MoodShifts Between 12:00 and 12:30
```

> ActiveShell interacts with **structured identity**, not just flat data.

---

## A4. RGNN Reasoning Topology

```mermaid
graph TD
    Patient["Patient A"] --> Diagnosis["Diagnosis: Anxiety"]
    Diagnosis --> Behavior["Frame: Pacing"]
    Behavior --> RGNN["RGNN Engine"]
    RGNN --> Pattern["Inferred Pattern: Agitation"]
```

**Relational Graph Neural Networks**:
- Extend AGNs with memory-injected reasoning
- Traverse time-aware structures
- Carry forward schema and policy inheritance

---

## A5. Pattern Inference and Scene Transitions

```python
def is_scene_shift(prev_frame, current_frame, threshold=30):
    diff = np.mean(cv2.absdiff(prev_gray, current_gray))
    return diff > threshold

if is_scene_shift(prev_frame, current_frame):
    flush_tensor()
    update_identity(n, timestamp=T)
```

- Scene shifts = Identity transitions
- AGNs flush & commit frames when change (Δn) exceeds significance

> **Memory forms when meaning changes.**

---

## A6. Semantic Inheritance Model (Schema Flow)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Condition["Parent Node: Diagnosis Schema"]
    Condition --> Patient1["Patient Node A"]
    Condition --> Patient2["Patient Node B"]
    Patient1 --> Frame1["Frame: April 15"]
    Patient2 --> Frame2["Frame: April 16"]
```

> **Schemas propagate meaning** to child nodes unless explicitly overridden.

---

## A7. Visualizing Identity Shift

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["n₀ = Calm, Structured"] -->|Scene Shift| B["n₁ = Chaotic, Distorted"]
    B --> C["n₂ = Reflective, Stabilized"]
```

> Identity is the shape data takes through change.

---

## A8. From Perception to Prediction

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input["🎥 Camera Frame"] --> Cortex["Visual Cortex"]
    Cortex --> Tensor["Tensor Stream"]
    Tensor --> AGN["AGN Node"]
    AGN --> Query["ActiveShell"]
    Query --> RGNN["RGNN Inference"]
    RGNN --> Action["Decision / Prediction"]
```

## Appendix Summary

- AGNs structure **temporal memory and meaning**
- Identity evolves through **structured relationships and time**
- Scene shifts, frame diffs, and policy inheritance are **first-class** operations
- Querying the system means **traversing living memory**

> _You’re not just modeling data anymore. You’re modeling **becoming**._
